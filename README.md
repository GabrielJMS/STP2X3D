# NIST STEP to X3D Translator (STP2X3D)
The NIST [STEP to X3D Translator](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/step-x3d-translator) is an open-source software that translates a STEP (ISO 10303) Part 21 file (.stp or .step) to an X3D (ISO/IEC 19776) file (.x3d) or [X3DOM](https://www.x3dom.org/) file (.html). Developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the software is based on the [Open CASCADE STEP Processor](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt_user_guides__step.html) and written in C++.  

## Prerequisites
- [Open CASCADE Technology](https://www.opencascade.com/content/latest-release) (OCCT) 7.5.0 or higher
  - You must rebuild the OCCT solution to regenerate DLL files.
    - vc14 or higher (x64) should be selected.
  - The complete set of DLL files required for STP2X3D to run is as follows.
    - OCCT related: freetype.dll, TKBO.dll, TKBRep.dll, TKCAF.dll, TKCDF.dll, TKernel.dll, TKG2d.dll, TKG3d.dll, TKGeomAlgo.dll, TKGeomBase.dll, TKHLR.dll, TKLCAF.dll. TKMath.dll, TKMesh.dll, TKPrim.dll, TKService.dll, TKShHealing.dll, TKSTEP.dll, TKSTEP209.dll, TKSTEPAttr.dll, TKSTEPBase.dll, TKTopAlgo.dll, TKV3d.dll, TKVCAF.dll, TKXCAF.dll, TKXDESTEP.dll, TKXSBase.dll
    - VC++ related: msvcp140.dll, vcruntime140.dll (vcruntime140_1.dll will also be required when vc141 or higher was used to build.)
    
## Build the STEP to X3D Translator 

  ### Windows
  - Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.12.2 or higher to build the software.
    - vc14 or higher (x64) should be selected for the generator.
  - You can also create a new project, include source files, and build the project in Visual Studio.
    - Be sure to use Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 due to [std::experimental::filesystem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/standard-library/filesystem?view=msvc-150). This should be updated later.
  - Additional Directories should be added as follows.
    - Add "OCCTPath\inc" to Additional Include Directories.
    - Add "OCCTPath\win64\vc14\lib" to Additional Library Directories.
  
  ### Linux (tested Ubuntu 20.10 64bit)
  - Use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.12.2 or higher to build the software.
  - Modify lines 5-6 of ``STP2X3D/CMakeLists.txt`` to properly set link to OCCT on your local machine.
  - Run the following commands from the repository root directory (where this README is located):
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build  
  cmake ..
  make
  ```
